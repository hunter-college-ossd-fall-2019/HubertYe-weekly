Thoughts about Kevin Flemings's Visit
------
We learned alot about Bloomberg and the software that they make for their business.
I still do not have any idea on how it works, but I would assume that people who specialize in accounting and economics would know.
I do not believe I would need to know in the near future, but it is interesting to learn that large companies contribute to open source.
However, I think he was being vague in their involment in open source because I still do not know what part of the software is open source.
In contrast with what Bill Reyner said, I believe Bloomberg LLP does more relating to contributing to open source, since Kevin Flemings said they contribute back.
However, I do not recall much about Factset's involvement. 
Though that might be because it has been awhile and I could have forgot the details already. 

Issue Progress
------
Someone apparently addressed the issue I was going to do regarding the side bar, but I have not made any significant progress on that one, so it is fine.
So now my main goal is combing through their discord channel looking for a topic to write about.
Currently, I see that their problems is far above my expertise, so I'll keep combing for easy topics.
