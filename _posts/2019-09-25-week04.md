Comments on Today's Activity
------
**Usefulness**
Today's activity of manipulating one github repository was a very interesting experience. It let me experience how the Git Bash worked with the three commands that were in the file. It also allowed me to see what the common problems is when working in a team on Github on our local machines. 

**Confusing?**
With the commands listed, it was not confusing at all because it contained the information about what it does. However, what the Git Bash returned, I had no idea what it means at the moment. But since I see it was successful and not giving me red error messages, I assume everything went fine. 

**Enough Time**
Yes, there was plenty of time to do the activity. Personally I think there was too much time as I finished a few minutes after the activity started. The most time was probably resolving he conflicts, which I'll explain in the next section.

**Merge Conflicts?**
I did have several merge conflicts. However, I had no idea how to deal with it via the Git Bash so I manually did it via Notepad++ which I opened directly on my computer and then changed it manually. It wasn't really explained in the thing how to deal with it, but I compared it with the version in the repository and then modified it to match. A merge command was not given in the instructions, so I do not know how I merge the two together.

Opinions about the Reading

I didn't read them yet, but I'll do it later.
