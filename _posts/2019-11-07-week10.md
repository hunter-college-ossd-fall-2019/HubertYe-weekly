Investigations on Wikipedia
------
Because I rummage around wikipedia alot, especially the [dandwiki](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page), I know by fact that there are several pages that will always need work.
The majority of these are topics that I have read for my old classes for studying purposes, but I did not understand what the wikipedia article meant.
But now, months/years later, I feel like I have the opportunity to make a few changes.

Issue Progress
------
I have recently obtained feedback from someone regarding [this issue](https://github.com/the-programmers-hangout/website/issues/88). 
So since I am now also on their Discord channel, I'll start rummaging through it to look for things to write an article about.
After I do that, I'm going to write up the article and do a pull request.
