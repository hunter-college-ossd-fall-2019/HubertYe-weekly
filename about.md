Hello, 

My name is Hubert Ye, and I am currently a student of Hunter College and I am writing this blog for my computer science class.

### More Information

I am currently the President of Hunted Hero Comics and I hope to make more resources to help my club members.

As I am short on time at the moment, I will upload more at a later date.

Thank you!
